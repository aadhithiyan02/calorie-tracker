# calorie-tracker
This project "Calorie Tracker" tracks the calorie taken in a day by the user. The user inserts the calorie of the food taken in a day, along with nutrients from the food such as fat, protein and carbohydrates. The user first creates a goal for his day. For every entry given by the user, the food and its calorie and nutrient information are stored in a list with the help of classes and objects. To make user easily track his calorie intake, there are several graph visualisation such as the goal Vs intake, intake levels of each nutrients so that the user can easily be able to understand and track his food better.
